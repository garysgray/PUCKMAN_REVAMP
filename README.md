PUCKMAN (Revamped)

A rebuilt version of my original HTML5 PUCKMAN game.
Modular, cleaner, and designed to be easier to extend.

Built with vanilla JS and Canvas, and attempting to use my meger HIT_ME HTML5 game engine v1
Runs directly in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge); no build step needed.
